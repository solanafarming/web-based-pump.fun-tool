# web-based-pump.fun-tool
A web-based pump.fun tool with bundling functionality up to 20 wallets, bump botting and an intuitive interface to ensure you receive the necessary information in real time. I am selling the source code to this, you can run it yourself or set it up as a service as that is what I built it with the intention of.

I was planning on offering this bot as a service but I no longer have the time nor hunger to do so (thanks to some self sufficient bots I developed). This bot is completely ready to be ran as a service and offers some in my opinion advantageous functionality compared to other services out there, mainly the control the bot gives the user. Instead of having to finick around a command line you can simply buy and sell from whatever wallet as you please. It has bundling and bump bot functionality, furthermore the bot allows you to never have to look at pump.fun for information as the dashboard presents all of the buys and sells to you (yellow for wallets that aren't yours and green for wallets that are yours) in real time. You can also simply press down on your middle mouse button to show you all of the SOL in the token not owned by you. Also on bullx the buys and sells from these wallets will appear as 'normal' users as their transactions will have the icons next to them, such as trojan, photon etc.

COMMANDS
