# web-based-pump.fun-tool
A web-based pump.fun tool with bundling functionality up to 20 wallets, bump botting and an intuitive interface to ensure you receive the necessary information in real time. I am selling the source code to this, you can run it yourself or set it up as a service as that is what I built it with the intention of.
